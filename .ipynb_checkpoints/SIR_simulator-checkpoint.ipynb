    "Epidemics are intrinsically stochastic systems, therefore, it is natural to attempt to capture aspects of the random elements of an epidemic using a stochastic (that is, a Monte Carlo) model. Other models attempt to estimate the *mean* behavior of epidemics. Such models should be consistent with and, ideally, follow from the stochastic model as we show below.\n",

    "A stochastic model deals with transition probabilities over a time interval $h$ that is so short that only one of $K$ possible things that can happen in the interval $(t, t + h)$ occurs. The key idea is to assume a state at time $t + h$ and relate it probabilistically to the possible states at time $t$. The counts $m$ and $n$ define the state of the stochastic system. In this model we assume that only three things can happen: 1) an infection occurs or 2) a recovery of removal from the infected category occurs or 3) nothing happens. The transition probabilities are:\n",
